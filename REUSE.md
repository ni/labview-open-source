# REUSE Policy – NI Open-Source Governance Bundle

This release bundle follows an open reuse policy consistent with  
[NI Open-Source Governance Framework](https://github.com/ni/open-source).

## ✅ You May:
- Copy, modify, and redistribute governance `.md` files
- Reuse milestone formats, changelogs, and template logic
- Embed GitHub Actions in your own governance workflows
- Adapt badge or scoring triggers for other OSS systems

## ❌ You May Not:
- Strip author attribution (`@svelderrainruiz`)
- Claim generated outputs as non-governance artifacts
- Obscure changelog traceability

## 📘 License:
This bundle is published under BSD Zero Clause License (`0BSD`)  
All runtime templates and policy content are explicitly reuse-approved

Maintainer: @svelderrainruiz  
Framework: v2025.05-governance-hardened
