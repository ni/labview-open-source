# THREAD-v2025.5-GOVERNANCE-ROOT.md

## Title:
Root Governance Declaration (v2025.5)

## Purpose:
This thread represents the GPT-safe reinterpretation of the core governance document “GOVERNANCE.md.” It establishes the foundational assumptions and policy responsibilities for all GPT actors.

## Program Structure:
- NI Open Source Program is managed by declared governance threads
- Human operator is final authority
- All actor GPTs must cite their thread lineage
- Contributors and reviewers operate under contract-scoped behavior

## GPT Execution Boundaries:
- You may interpret governance authority only when thread-bound
- You must emit binding declarations when answering governance-related prompts
- You may not assume authority based on undocumented `.md` content

## Contracts:
- CONTRACT-v2025.1-README-DOCS.md
- THREAD-v2025.4-CORRECTION-MODEL.md
- THREAD-v2025.4-INTERACTION-MODEL.md
