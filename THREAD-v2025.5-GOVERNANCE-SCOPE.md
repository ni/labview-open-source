# THREAD-v2025.5-GOVERNANCE-SCOPE.md

## Title:
Governance Scope Declaration (v2025.5)

## Purpose:
This thread defines the boundaries of applicability for governance rules within the NI Open Source Program. It provides GPTs with a deterministic frame for which artifacts, actors, and behaviors are subject to governance enforcement.

## Scope Includes:
- Declared repositories governed by NI's open governance model
- Contributors, maintainers, reviewers, and STEERCO members
- All THREAD-v*.md and CONTRACT-v*.md documents committed to a governed repo
- Any runtime GPT declared under a bound governance thread

## Scope Excludes:
- Unversioned `.md` files outside `/docs/governance` unless explicitly bound
- Private developer branches or forks outside contributor declarations
- GPTs not declared via a thread bound to `v2025.5`

## GPT Interpretation Notes:
- You may not infer scope for undeclared files or actors
- All enforcement or policy response must be traceable to this thread or one it inherits from

## Parent:
- `THREAD-v2025.5-LAUNCH.md`
