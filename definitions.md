### 📄 [docs/certification/dashboard-metadata.yml]

**📍 Path:** `docs/certification/dashboard-metadata.yml`  
**🧠 Purpose:** Stores contributor metadata derived from forms and GitHub signals, used for visibility in certification dashboards.

**✅ Commit Message:**  
`Add dashboard metadata file for certification visibility`

**📝 Commit Description:**  
This file introduces `dashboard-metadata.yml` as the canonical store of form-derived contributor activity that may influence recognition.  
It captures opt-in status, discussion links, and derived recognition tags (e.g., `recognition-missing`, `confidence-4`).  
This file enables dashboards or downstream exports to reflect contributor engagement **without triggering badge automation or scoring**.  
It exists under `v2025.08` as the surface layer of visibility — safe, auditable, and aligned with `CONTRIBUTOR-RECOGNITION.md`.

**📌 PR Title:**  
`Add Certification Metadata File for Contributor Dashboard`

**📬 PR Body:**  
Adds `dashboard-metadata.yml` to the certification visibility layer.  
Includes contributor `@crossruls` (opted-in) and derived tags.  
This is a non-scoring metadata view for audit and export reference.

**📎 GPT Summary:**  
This file was produced under `v2025.08` to represent visible certification signals from public contributor activity.  
It feeds into later export profiles but remains metadata-only to preserve audit safety.

`Generate export-visible certification metadata for team visibility`

**📝 Commit Description:**  
This export file provides a simulated downstream format of contributor recognition metadata for use by the NI Certification Team.  
It aligns with `dashboard-metadata.yml` and expands its fields into a machine-readable, export-oriented structure.  
It includes handle, consent status, GitHub links, and derived recognition tags.  
This file does not include badge decisions or CEU scoring — it exists to **inform, not automate** recognition review.  
Governance constraints from `CONTRIBUTOR-RECOGNITION.md` and `RECOGNITION-TAG-MAP.md` are enforced in full.

**📌 PR Title:**  
`Simulated Export Format for Certification Recognition Metadata`

**📬 PR Body:**
