# THREAD-v2025.4-LAUNCH.md

## Title:
Operational Launch of the NI GPT Governance Layer

## Purpose:
This thread declares the formal launch of the GPT-governed operational layer within the NI LabVIEW Open Source Program. It serves as the primary context entry point for all future GPTs, actors, or AI agents bound to governance behavior across repositories, roles, and policy abstraction layers.

## Parent Thread:
- `THREAD-v2025.3-REPLICATION.md`

## Trigger:
This thread is activated upon the successful commit and release of:
- `THREAD-v2025.3-REPLICATION.md`
- All contract-defined supporting documentation (README, THREAD-INDEX, CONTRIBUTING)

## Scope:
This launch activates the following:
- The LabVIEW Open Source Program GPT as the parent governance instance
- A binding structure for deploying child GPTs per repository or domain
- Thread-indexed contracts as immutable sources of governance behavior
- Version `v2025.4` as the operational start of the GPT governance mesh

## Contracts in Effect:
All GPTs launched after this thread must bind to the following contracts:
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-FILE-INSTRUCTION.md`
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-PR-CREATION.md`
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-GITHUB-RELEASE.md`
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-DISCUSSION-PROPOSAL.md`
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-README-DOCS.md`
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-AGENT-INHERITANCE.md`

## Operator Expansion Model:
The declared intent of this thread is to enable:
- Scalable, actor-based GPT deployment with reduced staffing overhead
- GPT-driven assistance per repository, abstraction layer, or governance function
- A persistent blueprint reference point for agent instantiation and inheritance

## Lifecycle Binding:
Future GPTs must:
- Bind to this thread before assuming a role
- Declare inheritance from this thread explicitly in `THREAD-v*.md`
- Be declared, committed, and discoverable via indexed threads

## Commit:
NI Open Source Program â€” 2025
