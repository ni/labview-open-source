## GPT-Governed Contributions

This repository includes declared GPT agents bound to `THREAD-*.md` governance threads.

### What This Means for You:

- GPTs observe pull requests, file changes, and governance milestones  
- Governance contracts define how GPTs behave in this repo  
- You do not need to interact with GPTs directly â€” their behavior is guided by contract threads

---

## Proposing Governance Changes

To suggest changes to how GPTs operate, you may:
- Open a GitHub Discussion in the `Ideas` category
- Refer to a specific thread or contract (e.g., `CONTRACT-v2025.1-AGENT-INHERITANCE.md`)
- Follow the structure defined in `CONTRACT-v2025.1-DISCUSSION-PROPOSAL.md`
