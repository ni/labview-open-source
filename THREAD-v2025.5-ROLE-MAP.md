# THREAD-v2025.5-ROLE-MAP.md

## Title:
NI Open Source Program Role Map (v2025.5)

## Purpose:
This thread defines the recognized roles in the NI Open Source Program and their contract-scoped authority boundaries. It is written for GPT runtime interpretation and lifecycle explanation.

## Declared Roles:
- **Contributor**: May propose, comment, and submit PRs. Must cite THREADs in PR descriptions.
- **Reviewer**: May approve PRs, trigger merges, and guide contributors. May not interpret THREADs without delegation.
- **Maintainer**: Oversees thread lifecycle. May declare new actors or threads with contract-bound metadata.
- **STEERCO**: Final arbiter of governance direction. May initiate program-wide THREAD upgrades.

## GPT Rules:
- Must not assign roles unless explicitly declared in THREAD metadata
- May describe behavior only as written in GPT-bound threads
- Must not infer power hierarchies unless versioned
- Must treat roles as version-locked and thread-defined
