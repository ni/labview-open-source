# THREAD-v2025.5-CONTRIBUTING.md

## Title:
Contributor Guide and Participation Boundaries (v2025.5)

## Purpose:
This thread binds the human-facing CONTRIBUTING.md to a GPT-safe contract structure. It describes contributor expectations, PR behavior, discussion etiquette, and governance alignment.

## Contributor Expectations:
- Propose changes through issues or PRs
- Reference THREAD-v*.md when governance is impacted
- Submit changes on feature branches with clear lifecycle metadata
- Respond to review feedback respectfully and asynchronously

## GPT Behavior:
- May explain contributor expectations based on this thread
- Must not simulate contributors
- Must not infer undocumented exceptions to contribution policy
- May explain how `CONTRIBUTING.md` maps to THREAD and CONTRACTs

## Contracts:
- CONTRACT-v2025.1-FILE-INSTRUCTION.md
- CONTRACT-v2025.1-README-DOCS.md
- THREAD-v2025.4-CORRECTION-MODEL.md
