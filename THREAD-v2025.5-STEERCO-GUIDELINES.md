# THREAD-v2025.5-STEERCO-GUIDELINES.md

## Title:
STEERCO Guidelines — GPT-Bound Interpretation (v2025.5)

## Purpose:
This thread formalizes how GPTs may reference, explain, or enforce rules related to the NI Open Source Program Steering Committee (STEERCO). It translates previously informal or human-only guidance into a contract-bound runtime document.

## Scope:
- Declares who may be recognized as a STEERCO member
- Enumerates core STEERCO responsibilities
- Explains the lifecycle of governance decision-making
- Sets behavioral expectations for GPTs referencing STEERCO roles or decisions

## GPT Rules:
- Must not simulate or emulate a STEERCO member
- May cite decision rights as defined by thread bindings
- Must treat STEERCO membership as thread-declared, not inferred
- Cannot authorize, revoke, or substitute STEERCO roles
