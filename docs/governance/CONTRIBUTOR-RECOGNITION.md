# üèÖ Contributor Recognition Policy

> Defines how contributors to the NI Open-Source Program are recognized via badges, public credit, and trust signals ‚Äî based on measurable, GitHub-visible contributions.

---

## Recognition Purpose

Contributor recognition exists to:
- Acknowledge sustained leadership and initiative support
- Encourage structured, transparent contributions
- Provide incentives aligned with certification, resume building, and long-term community trust
- Signal readiness for roles like SteerCo, Maintainer, or Core Team

---

## Recognition Principles

- Must be **public, earned, and traceable**
- Must be **opt-in** only
- Must be anchored in GitHub activity (issues, PRs, test reports)
- Recognition is **independent of employment or affiliation**
- Tier complexity is avoided unless program scaling justifies it

## Badge Types and Criteria

| Badge               | Criteria                                                                                      | Tracked Through                  |

## How Badges Are Issued

Badge issuance must follow this protocol:

- **Consent required** (opt-in confirmed in PRs or Discussions)
- **Manual review** by Program Manager (or Core Team if delegated)
- **Nomination allowed** via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ni/open-source/discussions/22)

> ‚ùó Recognition without template or opt-in evidence must be reviewed using `#manual-override`.

---

## Public Acknowledgment Channels

Opted-in contributors may be listed in:

- GitHub `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTORS.md`
- NI Connect slides or conference materials
- Internal/external NI newsletters
- Recognition dashboards

Recognition status may influence:
- SteerCo invitations
- Roadmap access
- Certification scoring visibility

---

## Future Automation Goals

- Badge logic integrated into GitHub Actions via labels, template detection, and contribution metadata
- Personal dashboards showing recognition + recertification readiness
- Contributor status feeds for project maintainers and reviewers
