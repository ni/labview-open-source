A governance README must:
- Reside in a declared governance version directory (e.g., `/governance/v2025.5/`)
- Provide index-level navigation to THREAD and CONTRACT files
- Declare version, status, and purpose

## ยง3.0 Required Sections

- Runtime declaration (version, status, source)
- File structure or index
- Role reference or interface
- Human operator model (if applicable)

## ยง4.0 Structural Enforcement
