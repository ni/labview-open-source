NI Runtime Governance v2025.5 is the first fully declared and enforceable governance cycle. It introduces a complete THREAD and CONTRACT model to govern behavior, roles, and runtime safety for contributors, GPTs, and the STEERCO.

## âœ… Activation

This governance runtime is frozen at:

```
Tag: v2025.5-runtime
Branch: main
```

All GPTs, validators, contributors, and governance tools must interpret governance behavior **strictly under this snapshot**.

Any governance updates must occur under a future version (e.g., `v2025.6`) and declare their own runtime tag.
