# Finalization Log — NI Governance v2025.5

This log formally records the steps taken to declare NI Runtime Governance v2025.5 as an enforceable, testable, and frozen runtime version.

---

## 🗓️ Finalization Date

2025-05-29

---

## 🏷️ Runtime Tag

```
Tag: v2025.5-runtime
Branch: main
```

---

## 🔁 Runtime Scope

This tag locks the following state:

- All THREAD and CONTRACT files under:
  - `docs/governance/v2025.5/threads/`
  - `docs/governance/v2025.5/contracts/`

- All runtime support files under:
  - `docs/governance/v2025.5/runtime/`

- All human-facing interface and onboarding documents under:
  - `docs/governance/v2025.5/interface/`

- Release metadata under:
  - `docs/governance/v2025.5/release/`

---

## 🧠 Runtime Purpose

This tag represents the **authoritative version of v2025.5** for:

- GPT interpreters
- CI validators
- Proposal reviewers
- Governance test harnesses
- Contributor onboarding

Any changes to governance behavior, structure, or file declarations must be introduced under a future governance cycle (e.g., `v2025.6`) with its own declared and runtime tags.

## 📄 Final Runtime Artifacts

- `governance-manifest.json` → runtime-locked with `"declared_tag": "v2025.5-runtime"`
- `README.md` → points to `v2025.5-runtime` as operational version
- `GPT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` files (test harness, evaluator) → explicitly scoped to `v2025.5-runtime`
- `GPT-TEST-RESULTS-v2025.5.md` → runtime-tagged
- `RELEASE-NOTES-v2025.5.md` → reflects declared structure at runtime lock-in
