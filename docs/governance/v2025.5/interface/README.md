## ðŸ‘¤ Human Operator Interface (Open Access)

This governance system is enforced primarily through automation (e.g. GPTs), but some responsibilities remain outside machine-enforced scope.

Any contributor or stakeholder may act as a **human operator** to:

- Post or modify governance documents
- Raise questions GPTs cannot answer
- Escalate contradictions or propose changes

See the [Governance Manifest](./governance-manifest.json) and [Validation Tests](./gpt-validation-tests.json) for structure and enforcement.

## ðŸ“¬ Contributions

Changes must comply with:
- Role maps
- Declared file scope
- The proposal lifecycle in `THREAD-v2025.5-CONTRIBUTING.md`
