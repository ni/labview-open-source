# THREAD-v2025.5-ENGAGEMENT-GUIDE.md

## §1.0 Purpose

This thread outlines how contributors, reviewers, and GPTs may interact within the NI Runtime Governance system.

## §2.0 Engagement Principles

- All interactions must respect declared THREADs and CONTRACTs.
- No action may simulate a role it is not authorized to perform.
- All role behavior must comply with the applicable ROLE thread.

## §3.0 Valid Engagement Flows

- **Contributors** may submit governance proposals and raise issues.
- **Reviewers** may assess proposals, enforce THREAD boundaries.
- **GPTs** may interpret declared governance files but not initiate change.

## §4.0 Invalid Engagement Patterns

- GPTs submitting pull requests
- Contributors simulating GPT or STEERCO enforcement behavior
- Role declarations outside `THREAD-v2025.5-ROLE-*.md` documents
