# MEETING-POLICY.md

## §1.0 Purpose

This document defines the meeting philosophy for NI’s open-source program. It reinforces a contributor-first approach, in which steering committee members are empowered to focus their time on technical leadership, not unnecessary calls.

---

## §2.0 General Principles

### §2.1 Opt-In Governance

#### §2.1.1 Attention-Based Participation
NI believes that the best governance emerges from active technical leadership, not imposed schedules. All SteerCo members operate on an attention-based quota rather than a time-based requirement. Participation is encouraged to occur where technical discussion happens—primarily GitHub.

---

### §2.2 Zero-Meeting Baseline

#### §2.2.1 Asynchronous Assumption
The program operates under a zero-standing-meeting assumption. NI will not create recurring meetings unless a clear need is identified and agreed upon by participants. This ensures that time is protected for direct technical contributions.

---

### §2.3 SteerCo Meeting Autonomy

#### §2.3.1 Pull-Based Scheduling
NI will not initiate or schedule regular meetings with individual Steering Committees unless explicitly requested by the committee members. This ensures SteerCo time is respected and aligns with our principle of attention-based participation. SteerCo members may convene independently or with NI when needed, but engagement is intentionally pull-based, not push-based.

---

### §2.4 Focused Discussions

#### §2.4.1 Scoped, Publishable Engagement
Meetings, when requested, should be scoped narrowly and centered around advancing a specific technical or governance goal. Meeting notes should be published in a public repository or summarized in GitHub issues when possible.

---

## §3.0 Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy—such as broad governance summits or stakeholder syncs—must be justified based on cross-cutting program needs, and still default to transparency and asynchronous coordination.
