# MEETING-POLICY.md

## Â§1.0 Purpose

This document defines the **program-wide meeting philosophy** for NIâ€™s Open-Source Program.  
It reinforces an async-first approach in which technical contributions are prioritized over synchronous coordination.

> ðŸ›‘ All structured meetings are limited to **Steering Committee participants** and are defined in [`STEERCO-GUIDELINES.md Â§4`](./STEERCO-GUIDELINES.md#Â§4-meeting-policy).

## Â§2.0 General Principles

### Â§2.1 Opt-In Governance

#### Â§2.1.1 Attention-Based Participation
The best governance emerges from active technical leadership, not imposed schedules. All contributors, including NI participants, operate on an attention-based quota. Participation is encouraged to occur where technical discussion happensâ€”primarily GitHub.

---

### Â§2.2 Zero-Meeting Baseline

#### Â§2.2.1 Asynchronous Assumption
The NI Open-Source Program operates under a zero-standing-meeting assumption for all contributors outside of SteerCo. NI will not create recurring contributor-wide meetings unless a clear need is identified and agreed upon publicly. Time is protected for direct technical contributions.

---

### Â§2.3 Pull-Based Engagement

#### Â§2.3.1 No Push Scheduling
NI will not initiate recurring meetings with contributors unless explicitly requested by governance participants. Engagement is intentionally pull-based, not push-based.

---

## Â§3.0 Structured Meetings

All formal meeting structures (cadence, scope, note-taking) are defined in [`STEERCO-GUIDELINES.md`](./STEERCO-GUIDELINES.md).  
This file only establishes the async-first baseline for the broader program.
