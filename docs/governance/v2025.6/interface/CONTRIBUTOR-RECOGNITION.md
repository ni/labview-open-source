# CONTRIBUTOR-RECOGNITION.md

> 🏅 This document defines how contributors to the NI Open-Source Program are recognized through public badges, acknowledgments, and long-term reputation signals.  
> It is intended to motivate and acknowledge individuals based on transparent, measurable contributions to the program’s success.

## §1. Purpose of Contributor Recognition

Contributor recognition serves to:

- Acknowledge sustained leadership and initiative support
- Encourage visible, measurable contributions
- Provide incentives aligned with recertification, resume building, and community trust
- Signal readiness for additional responsibility (e.g., SteerCo, Maintainer)

---

## §2. Recognition Principles

- Recognition must be **public, traceable, and earned**.
- Recognition is **not tied to employment** or company affiliation.
- All recognition must be **anchored in GitHub activity**, unless otherwise noted.
- The system avoids complex tiers unless justified by future program scaling.
