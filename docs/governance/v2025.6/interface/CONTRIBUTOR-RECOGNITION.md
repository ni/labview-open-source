# CONTRIBUTOR-RECOGNITION.md

> 🏅 This document defines how contributors to the NI Open-Source Program are recognized through public badges, acknowledgments, and long-term reputation signals.  
> It is intended to motivate and acknowledge individuals based on transparent, measurable contributions to the program’s success.

## §1. Purpose of Contributor Recognition

Contributor recognition serves to:
- Acknowledge sustained leadership and initiative support
- Encourage visible, measurable contributions
- Provide incentives aligned with recertification, resume building, and community trust
- Signal readiness for additional responsibility (such as SteerCo, Maintainer)

## §2. Recognition Principles

- Recognition must be **public, traceable, and earned**.
- Recognition is **not tied to employment** or company affiliation.
- All recognition must be **anchored in GitHub activity**, unless otherwise noted.
- The system avoids complex tiers unless justified by future program scaling.

## §3. Types of Recognition

| Badge | Criteria | Tracked Through |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 🛠 **Maintainer** | Actively reviews PRs, merges code, maintains repo health for >1 month | GitHub roles + PR history |
| 🧭 **SteerCo Member** | Publicly listed in accepted SteerCo with 2-hour/week engagement | GitHub discussions + onboarding form |
| 💬 **Top Contributor** | Authored accepted PRs, test reports, or meaningful discussions across 3+ issues | GitHub issue history |
| 🧪 **Test Coordinator** | Regularly verifies IP through manual test reports and community coordination | GitHub test issues + Projects |
| 🧱 **Infra Builder** | Creates GitHub Actions, CI pipelines, or contribution tooling adopted across repos | GitHub commit history |
| 🎓 **Certified Contributor** *(Planned)* | Integrated with NI recertification process via GitHub-linked tracking | TBD |

## §4. How Badges Are Issued

- Badges are **awarded manually** by the Program Manager, based on observable GitHub activity.
- Badge issuance is **documented publicly** in a repo discussion thread (such as `open-source/discussions/recognition`).
- No self-nomination is required—community and SteerCo members may propose nominees.

## §5. Public Acknowledgment Channels

- Recognized contributors will be listed on:
  - The program’s GitHub site (README/CONTRIBUTORS)
  - NI Connect slides (where applicable)
  - NI’s internal and external newsletters (if opted-in)
- Recognition status may influence SteerCo invitations and roadmap access

## §6. Future Automation Goals

As the program scales, we plan to:
- Automate badge tracking via GitHub Actions and metadata (such as label counting, PR authorship)
- Link recertification points to GitHub handles (in collaboration with the Certification team)
- Provide personalized dashboards for long-term contributor visibility
