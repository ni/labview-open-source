## §1. Purpose of Contributor Recognition

Contributor recognition serves to:

- Acknowledge sustained leadership and initiative support
- Encourage visible, measurable contributions
- Provide incentives aligned with recertification, resume building, and community trust
- Signal readiness for additional responsibility (e.g., SteerCo, Maintainer)

---

## §2. Recognition Principles

- Recognition must be **public, traceable, and earned**
- Recognition is **not tied to employment** or company affiliation
- All recognition must be **anchored in GitHub activity**
- There are **no tiers** or points for badge issuance; badges represent role-level acknowledgment

## §4. How Badges Are Issued

### §4.1 Manual Assignment
Badges are **awarded manually** by the Program Manager based on public GitHub activity, unless otherwise automated.

### §4.2 Public Documentation
Badge issuance is **documented publicly** in a GitHub thread (e.g., `open-source/discussions/recognition`)

### §4.3 Community Input
Community members may recommend recipients, but final authority rests with the Program Manager.

## §5. Appeals and Disputes

### §5.1 No Appeals Process
There is no formal process to dispute or appeal badge decisions.  
Top Contributor is automatically inferred; other badges are discretionary and final.
