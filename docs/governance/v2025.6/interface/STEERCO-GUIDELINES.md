# STEERCO-GUIDELINES.md

> 🧭 This document outlines the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of members serving on a Steering Committee (SteerCo) within the NI Open-Source Program.

## §1. Role of the Steering Committee

The SteerCo exists to provide **volunteer leadership and domain expertise** for a specific repository or technical category. SteerCo members:

- Represent real-world usage, integration, and testing of NI open-source IP
- Offer guidance on roadmap feasibility, documentation gaps, and community needs
- Are recognized publicly for their participation

> ❗ **SteerCo members do not vote on whether a repository is prioritized or launched.**  
> Their presence and engagement increase eligibility by signaling strong leadership availability, as defined in `PRIORITY-SCORE.md`.

## §2. SteerCo Authority and Boundaries

SteerCo members are *influencers, not approvers*.

| Area | SteerCo Role |
|------|---------------|
| 🧪 Technical Guidance | Review PRs, define usage patterns, surface bugs |
| 🧭 Evaluation Input | Assess interest and practicality (not final scoring) |
| 🔀 Community Engagement | Encourage external contributions and recognition |
| ❌ Governance Decisions | Cannot override program-level policies or make launch determinations |
| ❌ Priority Setting | Do not assign P0/P1/P2 directly; instead, increase repo readiness by being present and engaged |

## §3. Participation Expectations

| Commitment | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Weekly Time | ~2 hours/week per repo or category |
| Activity | GitHub reviews, issues, discussion replies, test coordination |
| Collaboration | Coordinate with other members, propose improvements |
| Independence | Members contribute as individuals—not company representatives |
| Transparency | All decisions and leadership must be visible and trackable on GitHub |

## §4. Meeting Policy

SteerCo meetings will be structured to protect contributors’ time and maintain momentum.

| Policy | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔄 Cadence | Governance meetings alternate biweekly with IP-specific meetings |
| 📝 Agendas | Agendas must be published 24 hours in advance and clearly scoped |
| ✂️ Separation | IP-focused meetings are scoped to a single repo or technical cluster; governance meetings address scoring, process, and program design |
| 📎 Recording | Key decisions must be documented in public GitHub threads or governance commits |

## §5. Joining or Leaving a SteerCo

To join a SteerCo:
- Fill out the public interest form
- Be selected based on relevance, expertise, or contribution history
- Commit to a 2-hour/week engagement model

To step down:
- Notify the Program Manager via GitHub or Discord
- Removal is non-punitive—members may return when ready

## §6. Recognition and Impact

SteerCo membership:
- Confers public recognition (badges and contributor credits are planned—see `CONTRIBUTOR-RECOGNITION.md`)
- Is a core signal of priority eligibility for the NI Open-Source Program
- Can influence NI product decisions—but only through structured and transparent engagement
