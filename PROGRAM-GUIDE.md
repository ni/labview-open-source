# ðŸ“˜ LabVIEW Governance Participation Guide

This repository extends the [NI Open Source Program](https://github.com/ni/open-source-program)  
to specifically govern LabVIEW-focused open-source repositories.

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

This repository defines governance rules, milestone behavior, and contributor roles  
specific to LabVIEW-related projects under NIâ€™s public open-source model.

It inherits all program-wide rules from:

ðŸ”— https://github.com/ni/open-source-program/releases/tag/v2025.99

## ðŸ“‚ Governed Repositories (LabVIEW Tier)

See [`REPOS-UNDER-GOVERNANCE.md`](./REPOS-UNDER-GOVERNANCE.md) for the current list.

## ðŸ¤– GPT Behavior

Lightweight GPT instances may bind to this repository using the GPT Capture model  
defined in [`GPT-CAPTURE-INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./GPT-CAPTURE-INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## ðŸ§¬ Inheritance Behavior

Repos governed by this domain should inherit:
- This `PROGRAM-GUIDE.md`
- LabVIEW-specific policy guidance
- Milestone-scoped instructions when applicable

Upstream governance remains the single source of truth for program-wide behavior.
