# LabVIEW Governance Layer â€” NI Open-Source Program

> ðŸ§­ This repository defines the LabVIEW-specific governance layer  
> for all open-source LabVIEW modules governed under the  
> [NI Open-Source Program](https://github.com/ni/open-source).

It provides contributor templates, certification alignment, and roadmap context  
for projects that adopt the centralized rules defined in `ni/open-source`.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repo exists to:

- Serve as a **single entry point** for contributors to governed LabVIEW repos
- Define LabVIEW-specific expectations (test formats, PR structure)
- Track certification scoring and public badge eligibility
- Maintain a registry of officially governed LabVIEW repositories
- Ensure governance inheritance remains traceable, portable, and auditable

---

## ðŸ§± Governance Structure

- [`ni/open-source`](https://github.com/ni/open-source)  
  â†³ Canonical governance system (roles, scoring, override logic)

  - [`ni/labview-open-source`](https://github.com/ni/labview-open-source)  
    â†³ LabVIEW-specific governance: templates, cert rules, roadmap registry

    - [`labview-icon-editor`](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor)  
      â†³ âœ… First governed LabVIEW implementation

    - [`actor-framework`](https://github.com/ni/actor-framework)  
      â†³ Governed legacy framework with contributor scoring

    - [`labview-open-source-framework`](https://github.com/ni/labview-open-source-framework)  
      â†³ Governed foundation module designed for reuse and scaling

---

## ðŸ“„ Governance Milestone

This layer was formalized in:

- Pull Request: [#1](https://github.com/ni/labview-open-source/pull/1)
- Public record: [GitHub Discussion #2](https://github.com/ni/labview-open-source/discussions/2)

Framework version: `v2025.05-governance-hardened`

## âœ… Governed LabVIEW Repos

| Repo | Status |
|------|--------|
| [`labview-icon-editor`](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor) | âœ… First governed LabVIEW repo |
| [`actor-framework`](https://github.com/ni/actor-framework) | âœ… Governed with traceable participation |
| [`labview-open-source-framework`](https://github.com/ni/labview-open-source-framework) | âœ… Governed foundation module |

## ðŸ§  Strategic Intent

This repo does not replace core governance.  
It **extends it**, with a focus on:

- Language-specific contributor experience (LabVIEW)
- Certification integration for LabVIEW engineers
- Template enforcement across visual workflows (`.vi`, `.vim`, `.gvi`)
- Future roadmap tracking for governed tooling
