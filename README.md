# 🧠 NI Open-Source Metadata Framework — LabVIEW Implementation

![Framework Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-v2025.05--governance--hardened-brightgreen)

This repository implements the **NI Open-Source Metadata Framework** for LabVIEW-based open-source projects.  
It provides milestone-driven, opt-in contributor metadata collection and certification visibility — powered by GPT-executed governance logic.

All content is traceable, non-scoring, and structured to support contributor recognition, dashboard export, and runtime audit enforcement.
