# LabVIEW Open Source Program

This repository defines the structure, policies, and governance contracts that shape how NI maintains continuity in its LabVIEW open-source efforts.

GPT agents are declared and governed through structured versioned threads. These threads serve as behavioral blueprints and runtime references.

## GPT Role Registry

| Role                         | Thread Reference                          | Description                          |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| LabVIEW Open Source Program GPT | `THREAD-v2025.99-LABVIEW-OSP.md`           | Root authority for all child agents  |
| Governance Sentinel GPT      | `THREAD-v2025.99-GOVERNANCE-SENTINEL.md`   | Observes repository compliance and continuity milestones |

## Governance Threads

Declared in versioned `THREAD-*.md` files, governance threads encode the structure, behavior, and inheritance of GPT roles.

See the full index in [`docs/THREAD-INDEX.md`](./docs/THREAD-INDEX.md)

## Governance Contracts (v2025.1)

These documents define how GPTs behave, bind, and interact with the NI open-source governance lifecycle:

- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-FILE-INSTRUCTION.md`: Git Bash + Notepad editing model  
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-PR-CREATION.md`: Pull request formatting and metadata  
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-GITHUB-RELEASE.md`: Release tagging and notes  
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-DISCUSSION-PROPOSAL.md`: RFC-style governance discussion guides  
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-README-DOCS.md`: Documentation as machine-readable blueprint  
- `CONTRACT-v2025.1-AGENT-INHERITANCE.md`: Declares and enforces parent-child GPT binding
